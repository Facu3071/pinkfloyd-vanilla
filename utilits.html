<!-- HISTORY -->
<p>
  Pink Floyd are an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining an early following as one of the first British
  psychedelic groups, they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical
  lyrics
  and elaborate live shows. They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest
  progressive rock band of all time.
