It is my first JavaScript vanilla project. My main goal was to put in one only project things that I learned about manipulate dom and array methods, so what better than a website about my favorite band?. also, I learned about display grid, flexbox, responsive design, viewport units, and much more. I hope you enjoy it! :blush:
